<span>In this repository we use RAM model to try to analize algorithms.</span>

<span>The RAM model considers:</span>

<ul>
  <li>Arithmetic operations (+, -, *) are considered to be simple operations that take constant time</li>
  
  
  
  if, call) are considered to be simple operations that take one time step</li>
  <li>Loops are complex</li>
  <li>Memory access takes one time</li>
</ul>
