<H1>Welcome to testAlgho</H1>
  
<span>In this repository we use word model and Big O notation to analize algorithms.</span>

<span>The RAM model considers:</span>

<ul>
  <li>Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) are considered to be simple operations that take constant time</li>
  <li>Assigments ( = ) are consider simple operations. They take constant time</li>
  <li>Logical Operations (if, else) take constant time</li>
  <li>Memory access takes one time</li>
  <li>Loops (for, while) are complex</li>
</ul>

<span>In general, the size of the problem is called 'n'.</span>

<h2>Algho 1</h2>
<span>Let's say you have to display 100 numbers on the screen. The numbers are 0 to 99. A good approach would be use a 'for loop'! For instance: </span>

<ul>
  <li><b>for</b>( i=0 ; i<100 ; i++ )<b>System.out.println</b>(i);</li>
</lu>

We are using a 'for loop
