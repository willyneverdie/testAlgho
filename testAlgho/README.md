<H1>Welcome to testAlgho</H1>
  
<span>In this repository we use word model to analize algorithms.</span>

<span>The RAM model considers:</span>

<ul>
  <li>Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) are considered to be simple operations that take constant time</li>
  <li>Assigments ( = ) are consider basic operations. it takes constant time</li>
  <li>Logical Operations (if, else) take constant time</li>
  <li>Memory access takes one time</li>
  <li>Loops (for, while) are complex</li>
</ul>

In general, the size of the problem is called 'n'.
